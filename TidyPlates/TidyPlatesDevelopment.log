Notes:::;;

-- how to improve performance?
	- Unit Updates
	- Display Updates

	- Unit Data
		- On Update/Change:
			* What Indicators need to update?
			* Do we update everything?
			* What functions need to run?
			* How do we tell things to update?  Or should we just update everything?
				* Is it better to call a function to ask what should get updated?
				* Or should we just make it simple?

		- Data Categories:
			- High Frequency Changes (Health, Context, )
				- Should have a function that requests an update
			- Medium Frequency Changes (Quest Status?, )
			- Low Frequency Changes (Name, Class, Race, Faction)






* If Enemy Player is targetting you, High Threat is active
    if UnitIsUnit(unit.unitid.."target", "player") then print("Targetted by,", unit.name) end

    * Working on Grap[hite Elite Icon

* Color name on quest mobs?  Where  
   - Name color is controlled by a color function right now.  "By Quest" Can be an option.
   - Opacity and Scale Spotlight for Quest mobs
   - This should be overriden on Elite, Rare, and Powerful mobs.  
   - Threat Warning mode for Elite/Rare Mobs
   - 

   Name Color By Significance

   - Spotlight By Name?

   - (Done) Bypass Filter on Quest Mobs

   - Shjould have artwork for Rare mobs, or at least, a spotlight mode

   - Need to enable absorbs.
