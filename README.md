# Tidy Plates

Fork of Tidy Plates by Binbwen. I talked to him and have permissions to publish this release on the Curseforge page.

This current release should be working fine for the Shadowlands prepatch 9.0.1; I will make sure it works well and clean up the code over the next few days.
After that I will add some features I have in my local copy and make sure they actually work well enough to be a public feature.

Any contributions, help or suggestions is appreciated!
